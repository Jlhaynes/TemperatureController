by James L. Haynes

A temperature controller to control a refrigerator and/or a heater in order to precisely control fermentation
 temperature. This program supports three modes, Cooling, Heating, or Temperture Hold. It currently has a 
 fixed 1 degree of hysteresis. This project involves a custom .NET Gadgeteer based software project as well 
 as custom hardware modules and drivers. A software/hardware tutorial is available which describes the entire 
 project from start to finish.
